# WebGL-Raytracer

A raytracer made in WebGL. Play with it by going to Ray_tracer/index.html.

Change the RES on the bottom and click submit on the top right to run at a lower resolution for faster load times. Move around the scene by click-dragging and WASD-Z-Space. 


The skySphere scene is currently broken due to an update in a webGL API call.
Will fix soon.
